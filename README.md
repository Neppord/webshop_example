===============

this is not a real project just a example.

to run i though you need to install node. Do it from there homepage:
`http://nodejs.org/`
its easy for both mac and win, which have there installers. For linux it can be
a bit overwelming if your not used to `make` and `sudo make install`

Then for installing project dependencies:
`npm install`

and runing the project
`node app.js`


hope it helps!
